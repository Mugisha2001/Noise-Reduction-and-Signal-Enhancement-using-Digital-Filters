The filtered signals are cleaned versions of the noisy input, useful for improving audio clarity.
Application in Communication Systems:
This code simulates noise reduction and signal enhancement, which are crucial in communication systems for:

Audio Signal Processing: Enhancing voice clarity in VoIP, mobile communication, and broadcasting by reducing ambient noise.
Data Transmission: Minimizing interference in transmitted signals, ensuring accurate data recovery at the receiver end.
Adaptive Noise Control: Employing dynamic filters like LMS for real-time adjustments to unpredictable channel noise, commonly used in wireless communication and telephony.
